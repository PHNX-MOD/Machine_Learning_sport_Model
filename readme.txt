Before proceeding with predicting the winners, you should perform some data preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare your dataset for modeling. Since the Team's statistics are repeated when playing against different teams, you can aggregate these statistics to create features that represent a team's overall performance.

Here are the steps you can take to preprocess and prepare your data:

1. **Aggregate Statistics by Team**:
   - Group your dataset by the `TeamName` and calculate statistics like the mean, sum, or average for each of the performance metrics (e.g., `X2PM`, `X2PA`, `X3PM`, etc.) for each team. This will give you summary statistics for each team.

2. **Create Features**:
   - Create additional features that might be relevant for predicting winners. For example, you can calculate shooting percentages (e.g., Field Goal Percentage, Three-Point Percentage) from the aggregated data.
   - You can also calculate performance differentials between teams for each metric to capture relative strengths and weaknesses.

3. **Label Winners**:
   - Create a target variable (label) that indicates the winner of each fixture based on the game's final score or other criteria.
   - For example, if you have a score or a point differential in your dataset, you can use that information to determine the winner.

4. **Data Splitting**:
   - Split your data into training and testing sets to evaluate your model's performance.

5. **Feature Scaling**:
   - Depending on the machine learning algorithm you choose, you might need to scale or normalize your features to ensure that they have a consistent scale.

6. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Choose an appropriate machine learning model for your classification task (predicting winners).
   - Train the model using the training data.

7. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

8. **Prediction for 25th February, 2023**:
   - Prepare a subset of your data containing the fixtures for the 25th of February, 2023.
   - Use your trained model to predict the winners for those fixtures.

9. **Model Refinement**:
   - Depending on your model's performance, you may need to refine it by trying different algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, or feature engineering.

10. **Deployment**:
    - Once you are satisfied with your model's performance, you can deploy it to make real-time predictions or use it for future fixture predictions.

Remember that the choice of features, the selection of a machine learning algorithm, and the way you label winners will significantly impact the performance of your prediction model. Experiment with different approaches to find the best combination for your specific dataset and prediction task.
